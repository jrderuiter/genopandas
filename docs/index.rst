Introduction
============

GenoPandas is a library that provides various datastructures to support
manipulation, querying and plotting of genomic data in Python. To do so,
GenoPandas provides several pandas-based data structures, such as the
``GenomicDataFrame`` and ``AnnotatedMatrix`` classes, which can be used to
store different types of genomic data. For basic analyses, these classes
also provide a variety of different manipulation and plotting functions.

**Disclaimer: both library and documentation are works-in-progress and are
under active development. The API and other details may therefore be subject
to change.**
